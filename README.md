# Virtual ESP32 Keyboard

Program which allows you to connect one device via bluetooth and another via wifi to ESP32 and then send keystrokes using web interface hosted on 192.168.4.1

I wanted to create something similar to rubber ducky, but iâ€™m still waiting on my USB connectors to arrive so i decided to make something like this lol.

# List of keys:
- ctrl
- alt
- shift
- win
- enter
- esc
- tab
- f4

# Steps files:
Steps file is essentially .txt file that you import steps from. For example see example.txt
